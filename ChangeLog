2006-03-04  Nicholas Rahn  <nick@transparentech.com>

	* grism/portfolio.rb: Change the way the today_total (%) is 	calculated. Rather than using a straight average of the daily 	percent changes of each stock, calculate the change in value 	of the portfolio. This is slightly different, but seems more 	consistent.
	* grism/FolderWidget.rb: Double-clicking in the extended view 	TreeView (ratio view) also brings up the details dialog for 	the given stock.
	* install.bat: Updates for a completely smooth install on 	windows. Rename main grism file to grism.rbw so we don't start 	a DOS window with the Grism main window. .rb files are 	executable so we don't need the ruby to run setup.rb.
