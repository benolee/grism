Grism - A Stock Market Observation Tool


Homepage: http://www.grism.org

Grism allows you to track your favorite stocks in one of 2 modes:

1. Watchlist - See the stock's current price as well as a watch start
price so you can track how the stock has done since you began watching
it.

2. Portfolio - See the stock's current price as well as the price at
which it was purchased, the number of shares involved and gain/loss
calculations.


Grism currently uses the services provided by Yahoo! Finance to
retrieve current stock price quotes.  A special Ruby module
(YahooFinance) is used and also available as a separte module on
rubyforge.org.

Grism is written in Ruby and GTK+ and is release as free software under the GPL license version 2.
